# PRD: Weather-Based Outfit Recommendation for Outdoor Athletes

## tl;dr

Outdoor runners and cyclists often struggle to select optimal attire for safe, comfortable workouts due to variable weather. This web-based app removes uncertainty by generating science-backed, weather-driven outfit recommendations, calibrated with granular post-activity feedback. Tailored for outdoor athletes, the platform delivers actionable, personalized wardrobe guidance across desktop and mobile browsers.

## Goals

### Business Goals

* Acquire 10,000 registered users within the first 6 months post-launch.

* Achieve a weekly active user (WAU) rate of 40% or higher.

* Build brand credibility as a trusted technology partner for outdoor athletes and apparel brands.

* Establish repeat sponsorships/referral programs with at least two fitness apparel partners within the first year.

### User Goals

* Deliver weather-adaptive outfit recommendations to minimize pre-workout wardrobe uncertainty.

* Provide robustly personalized suggestions, factoring in comfort preferences and granular past feedback.

* Streamline pre-activity planning, improving user readiness and workout comfort.

* Allow users to log specific post-activity feedback to enhance future recommendations and continually refine model accuracy.

### Non-Goals

* Exclude direct apparel sales, e-commerce functions, and inventory management.

* Out of Scope : New wardrobe suggestions - Suggest new apparel to satisfy weather conditions and user preferences (e.g. suggest a vest and then some running company clothing for purchase.)

* No MVP support for smartwatch or native mobile apps—web experience only.

* Out of scope: Guidance for sports other than running/cycling, or for indoor activities.

## Functional Requirements

### Onboarding (High Priority)

* **Delightful guided onboarding** capturing user location, primary activity (run/cycle), and fundamental clothing/comfort preferences.

* Visually-driven tutorial (modal or carousel) effortlessly explains the recommendation process.

* **Confident First Recommendation:** When no individual history is available, leverage broader community data and climate-based best-practices to generate a highly relevant suggested outfit for the user's initial session.

### Personalized Outfit Recommendation Engine (High Priority)

* Integrates real-time weather variables (temperature, wind, precipitation, humidity).

* Accepts user input: sport type, time, duration, and location.

* Outputs recommended gear with visual assembly of clothing items and **confidence scores**.

* For first-time users, draws from anonymized community feedback and climate zone indexing to enable a strong initial recommendation.

* **Granular Model Calibration:** Feedback data and user profiles refine gear logic—detecting nuances (e.g., wind protection usage, impact of double-layering, microclimate effects).

* Should allow self-reporting of a workout (time, location, clothing worn) even if a recommendation wasn’t generated pre-workout.

### Post-Workout Wardrobe Rating Experience (High Priority)

* **Simple, visually engaging post-activity survey**:

  * Users specify each specific item worn (layer by layer, accessibly selectable from a curated clothing library).

  * Users rate comfort for key body zones:

    * *Head/Hands*

    * *Torso*

    * *Legs*

    * *Feet*

  * Rating scale: 5-point (“Very cold” to “Very hot”), or “Just right,” for each zone.

* **Purpose:** Enables precise, data-driven learning about both overall and zone-specific comfort, supporting advanced model calibration for future recommendations.

* Visual elements: Clothing/zone diagrams for intuitive feedback; clear transitions.

### Feedback Loop and Follow-up (High Priority)

* Within 6 hours of a scheduled workout, if post-activity feedback is absent, an **automated, friendly email** (“How did it go?”) prompts users to submit their experience, encouraging engagement and improving data fidelity.

### User Profile and Preferences (Medium Priority)

* Stores user comfort sensitivity, preferred apparel brands/types, and feedback history.

* Enables ongoing fine-tuning (e.g. “I run hot/cold”, preferred fabric types, aversion to certain gear).

### Weather Visualization (Low Priority)

* Dynamic graphics (charts/icons) summarize the weather’s key factors influencing the recommendation.

### Community Insights (Low Priority)

* Surfaces aggregated, anonymized wardrobe strategies and tips from users in similar weather conditions.

  * Recommendations detail garment choice, rationale (e.g., “Windbreaker due to 18 km/h gusts”), and confidence level.

  * “More Details” accordions clarify weather impact on the suggestion.

3. **Step 3: Post-Workout Wardrobe Rating**

  * **Zone-Specific Visual Feedback:** Users select clothing items worn for each zone (head/hands, torso, legs, feet), then rate comfort per zone.

## Narrative

Alice, an avid marathoner, dreads the daily wardrobe guesswork before outdoor runs. Wind or drizzle, she often misjudges layering—arriving overheated or chilled. Opening the app, she enters her route, timing, and comfort preferences. Instantly, she’s presented a vivid, tailored outfit: thermal base, light windproof shell, gloves. Each zone—torso, legs, feet—is visually addressed.

After her run, a simple diagram prompts: “Which items did you wear? How did each body zone feel?” Alice enjoys the clarity—she checks off “windbreaker,” rates her legs as a bit chilly, feet just right—and submits. Next week, the app remembers; if she forgets, a gentle “How did it go?” email nudges for her insights. Over time, layered feedback ensures Alice’s next outfit is even better. This ritual becomes a game-changer for Alice and like-minded athletes—embedding trust, utility, and delight.
